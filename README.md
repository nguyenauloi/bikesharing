## **Project Overview**
An analysis of NYC CitiBike's bikesharing data from August 2019 through Tableau. This analysis will be used to propose creating a similar bikesharing service in Des Moines

## Results

A snapshot of August 2019 shows that that:
 - There were over 2.3 million rides in just a single month
 - Of those riders:
    - 81% were subscribed to the service
    - The majority of riders are male
    - The service is being used by all ages

From this graph we can see that regardless of gender, riders tend to mostly use the service in the morning. Most likely opting to take a bike over driving a personal vehicle or taking a taxi.

Here we are able to see that usage continues to be consistent, independent of gender and weekday. The majority of riders are most likely using this service to get to or from work as indicated by the darker lines at both 8AM and 5PM. Weekends seem to be consistent throughout.

Finally, here we can see here that the service is being used consistently throughout the entire city.

## Summary
The bikesharing service has proved its usefulness in a place like New York City. Though Des Moines isn't as populated, it stands to reason that urban centers are open to alternatives to cars and even other public transportion options like busses or trains.
